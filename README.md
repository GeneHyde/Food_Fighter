Yea so I wrote almost all if not all of the code in this repository. Unfortunatly this is only a framework of the game
It has all the peices for a text baised rpg for dungon crawling but it does not have the content
(mostly because that wan't my job and writing this whole thing in a quarter was taxing enough).

If I could do one thing differently I would of used J-unit for the testing insted of those java test files
even if they worked more or less the same J-Unit just looks more professional.
